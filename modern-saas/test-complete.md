# Multi-Tenant Test Results ✅

## Automated Tests Passed
- ✅ Database schema created successfully
- ✅ RLS policies working correctly (blocking unauthenticated access)
- ✅ Development server running on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Sign-in page accessible
- ✅ App routes properly redirect unauthenticated users

## Manual Testing Guide

### 1. Authentication Flow Test
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/sign-in`
2. Sign in with Google OAuth (configured) or create email/password user
3. **Expected**: Redirect to `/(app)/[orgId]/dashboard`
4. **Expected**: Default org auto-created with name "[FirstName]'s Workspace"

### 2. Multi-Tenant Features Test
1. **Navbar**: Should show org switcher with current org name
2. **User Menu**: Should show user email and sign out option
3. **Dashboard**: Should display "Hello, you are in [OrgName]"

### 3. Access Control Test
1. Note your current org ID from the URL: `/(app)/[orgId]/dashboard`
2. Try accessing a fake org ID: `/(app)/fake-org-id-123/dashboard`
3. **Expected**: "No Access" page with "Go to my workspace" link

### 4. Org Switcher Test (Future)
- Currently shows single default org
- Hover over org name in navbar to see dropdown
- Will show multiple orgs when user joins additional organizations

## Database Verification
```sql
-- Check organizations table
SELECT * FROM organizations;

-- Check memberships table  
SELECT * FROM memberships;

-- Check RLS is working
SELECT current_user, auth.uid();
```
